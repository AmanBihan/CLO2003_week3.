 Introduction:
 
Like Windows, iOS, and Mac OS, Linux is an operating system. Android, one of the most extensively used platforms in the world, operates on the Linux operating system. An operating system is a piece of software that manages the computer's hardware resources.
• Section 1: Linux History:

A popular open-source operating system is Linux. It was initially created by Linus Torvalds in 1991. At the time, Torvalds was a computer science student at the University of Helsinki, Finland and began working on the Linux project as a personal endeavour. The name Linux is a combination of his first name, Linus, and Unix, the operating system that inspired his projects. At the time, most operating systems were proprietary and expensive. Torvalds wanted to create an operating system that was freely available to anyone who wanted to use the operating system, He originally released Linux as free software under the GNU General Public License. This meant that anyone could use, modify, and redistribute his source code.
Today, Linux is one of the most widely used operating systems in the world, with an estimated 2.76% of all desktop computers and more than 90% of the world’s top supercomputers running on Linux, and approx. 71.85% of all mobile devices run on Android, which is, you guessed it, Linux-based. The Linux community has expanded to include thousands of developers and users who work on the creation and upkeep of the operating system.

• Section 2: Linux Distributions:

• Explain what Linux distributions are and why they are important.
Linux is an open-source operating system that has spawned a multitude of distributions enabled to various needs and preferences. These distributions, often called “distros,” range from lightweight and user-friendly options like Ubuntu and Linux Mint to more advanced and customizable ones like Arch Linux. Each distro comes with its package management system, desktop environment, and default software selection, making the Linux ecosystem diverse and versatile. Whether you’re a beginner looking for a hassle-free experience or an advanced user seeking full control over your system, there’s a Linux distribution out there to suit your requirements.

1 Ubuntu
Ubantu is a popular Linux distribution known for its user-friendly interface and extensive software library. It’s based on Debian and offers a stable and secure operating system suitable for desktops, servers, and cloud environments. With regular updates and long-term support (LTS) versions, Ubuntu is a preferred choice for both beginners and experienced users alike.

2. Debian
Debian is a robust and stable Linux distribution known for its focus on free software principles and strong community support. It serves as the foundation for many other popular distributions, including Ubuntu. Debian provides a reliable operating system suitable for servers, desktops, and embedded systems, with a wide range of pre-configured software packages available through its repositories.

4. Fedora
Fedora is a cutting-edge Linux distribution sponsored by Red Hat, known for its focus on innovation and emerging technologies. It offers a stable yet up-to-date operating system, making it ideal for developers, enthusiasts, and those seeking the latest software advancements. Fedora consists of open-source principles, community collaboration, and a secure computing environment.

6. CentOS
CentOS is a fre­e operating system. It come­s from the code of Red Hat Ente­rprise Linux. CentOS is very good for se­rvers. People like­ it because it works well. It doe­s not break or stop easily. The community he­lps make CentOS bette­r. Red Hat Enterprise Linux costs mone­y. But CentOS is free to use­. Many people choose Ce­ntOS for servers. They know it will ke­ep running without issues.

• Describe the differences between various distributions.

Fedora	Developers	DNF	Cutting-edge features, fast updates

Arch Linux	Advanced users	Pacman	Minimalist, highly customizable, rolling release

CentOS	Enterprises	YUM/DNF	Stability, security, based on RHEL

Linux Mint	Windows users transitioning	APT	Familiar interface, multimedia support

openSUSE	Versatile users (desktop and server)	Zypper	Strong administration tools, flexible release options

• Section 3: Basic Linux Commands:

1. ls command
2. 
The ls command lists the content of a folder, including files and directories. Here’s the syntax:
3. pwd command
4. 
To check the full path of your current working directory, use the pwd command. Its syntax is as follows:
5. cd command
6. 
Use cd to navigate between directories in your Linux VPS. It doesn’t have any option, and the syntax is simple:
7. mkdir command
8. 
The mkdir command lets you create one or multiple directories. The syntax looks like this:
9. rmdir command
10. 
Run rmdir to delete empty directories in your Linux system. The command syntax looks like this:
11. rm command
12. 
The rm command deletes files from a directory. You must have the write permission for the folder or use sudo. Here’s the syntax:
13. cp command
14.

19. file command
20. 
The file command checks a file type, such as TXT, PDF, or other. The syntax is as follows:

• Conclusion:

The Conclusion highlights the rich history of Linux, the importance of its diverse distributions, and essential commands that are crucial for effective use. Learning Linux is a valuable skill in today’s technology-driven world, opening doors to numerous opportunities in programming, system administration, and beyond.
